UPDATE 21/5/14: IFTTT has just released an official [fitbit channel](https://ifttt.com/fitbit). So I recommend everyone uses that. As a result &nbsp;I will discontinue my version &nbsp;at the end of this month. Thanks to everyone who tried and particularly those who tested my fitbit channel. I currently have plans for a 3rd party Snapchat Channel. So keep posted :)

My Fitbit channel for [IFTTT][2]is <del>being</del> made &#8211; <del>sorry to get your hopes up :/&nbsp;</del> and i need some people to test it

## Status

As we speak&nbsp;I&#8217;m currently coding a 3rd party IFTTT channel for Fitbit. It will work by pretending to be a wordpress blog. So unfortunately this channel would prevent the use of the WordPress channel I&#8217;m hoping to get the IFTTT channel out in<del>&nbsp;about a month&nbsp;</del> a week or so ( but that depends on how much help I get :P &nbsp;)&nbsp;&nbsp;The first version will only have actions. A future version may be made that has triggers as well.

However, as I don&#8217;t really have a use for that ( I don&#8217;t own a fitbit) it depends on if I get a fitbit &#8211; *please see below*

Speaking of which if you can donate/ find this project helpful or would like to increase your chance of getting triggers. Please help me buy a fitbit?

## How you can help

  * I am after some alpha/beta testers for the fitbit channel Update: anyone interested please go [here][3]&nbsp;and leave a comment on the post with any feedback
  * I&#8217;m curious about the legal requirements with holding medical/fitness data about individuals from all over the world. Obviously I wouldn&#8217;t keep the data for longer then I would be required to. So if you have an expertise in this area please contact me by leaving a comment.
  * Buy me a fitbit. I don&#8217;t have the money for one &#8211; I&#8217;m just a [kid][4]
