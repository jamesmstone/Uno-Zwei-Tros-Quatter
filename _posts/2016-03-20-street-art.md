Like in lots of places Swiss street art, was not seen in the same light as it is today.
One of the *fathers* of Swiss street art would have to be [Harald Naegeli](http://www.graffiti.org/zurich/naegeli.html). Harald, started painting *"wire frame"* works throughout the city of Zurich, which yet despite simple drawings, stood out from the bleak concrete walls earning him the name *"Sprayer of Zurich"*
![Harald Naegeli's Undine (1978)](/img/undine.jpg)
Harald work wasn't appreciated by, including the Swiss authorities and was apprehended in June '79, after he returned to one of his works after leaving his glasses there.
Before his court case he fled to Germany where he continued his work. He was eventually and reluctantly extradited by Germany after he tried to flee to Denmark and served his jail sentence. During this time a partition was set up 

Now days, his work is regarded by many as great art in both Germany and Switzerland.
The authorities have restored many of his surviving works. COnverting ti from an unofficial to and official tourist attraction.
So much so that when the building (University of Zurich) where Undine (seen above) was painted upon was renovated. The work was considered sufficiently valuable to cover it and protect int throughout the works.
