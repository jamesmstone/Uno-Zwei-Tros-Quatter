### International Engagement
Switzerland is heavily involved with many international organisation. It hosts numerous international headquarters such as: CERN - European Organisation for Nuclear Research, WHO - World Health Organisation, GAIN - Global alliance for improved Nutrition or the one I'll be talking about UNEP United Nations Environment Programme.
UNEP is the global authority on the environment. As someone who is studying Computer Science, I can see a world of ways in which technology is key to helping solve and diagnose some of the worlds environmental issue. 

The European headquarters of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is based in Geneva, Switzerland. This organisation is charged with the responsibility to find global solutions and strategies for the extreme threat of climate change. UNEP collects ans synthesizes environmental data from many organisations across the globe.

My specific disciplinary skills are in software development, these skills are extremely valuable to an organisation that collects processes and interprets such huge volumes of data.
There are many areas of focus within UNEP, including climate change, disasters and conflicts, eco-system management and environmental governance. An example of where these skills are already being used is "[The Madingley Model](http://www.madingleymodel.org/)", which is a partnership between UNEP and Microsoft to develop a general ecosystem model, a model that simulates all life on Earth.

The Madingly Model is particularly important as humans put more pressure on Earth's ecosystems.
 
I became aware of UNEP's work in Switzerland, though Microsoft's involvement. Microsoft also has a research center at the University of Melbourne, where I'm studying.

Can you identify a situation or an issue for meaningful international engagement in your country specialisation?

Describe the process by which you might identify a situation or an issue for meaningful international engagement in your country specialisation and how you could find out whether your particular disciplinary skills could contribute to improving that situation or issue.

Some points to think about:

the individuals, communities and/or authorities to consult 
your particular disciplinary skills
how/whether your skills can be adapted to different needs
the people or skills you would need to work with to bring about meaningful international engagement in your country specialisation
In your blogpost, you will need to:

explain the process by which you might identify the situation or issue
describe your contribution to the situation or issue and/or cooperation with other people possessing complementary skills
articulate how your approach constitutes meaningful international engagement



Switzerland is one of the wealthiest countries, with a high quality of life, it has four official languages (French, German, Italian, and Romansh), is prominent a member of the United Nations and has a motto *"Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno"* or in English *"One for all, all for one"*. Not only is Switzerland an International nation with four diverse languages, Switzerland is host to numerous international headquarters such as: CERN - European Organisation for Nuclear Research, WHO - World Health Organisation or GAIN - Global alliance for improved Nutrition.
Despite all this, the Swiss government seems reluctant to grow their diversity and help host refugees.  
Since the 1990's Swiss Asylum Law has required Asylum Seekers to contribute to the costs of hosting them. By law the country is permitted to confiscate assets from those seeking asylum. They are allowed to confiscate up to 1,000 Swiss francs (~ US$995 or ~ €913 euros).

As [*SwissInfo.ch*](http://www.swissinfo.ch/) puts it _"For some, Asylum Seekers are a drain on the economy and a threat to social stability; For others, helping them is a cornerstone of Switzerland’s humanitarian tradition"_ 

Compared to other nations in Europe, Switzerland is in a position where it can help. Recently the racism commission has been highly critical of the Swiss Government and the opposition in the lead up to the  federal election.  What's particularly interesting is how the Swiss feel. News media reports carried the results of a survey showed that just under half think the country should close its borders, at least temporarily, but yet most Swiss still feel it’s important to continue helping some of the hundreds of thousands of refugees trying to reach Western Europe through the Mediterranean. –   ([Source](http://www.swissinfo.ch/directdemocracy/hate-speech_racism-commission-sees-risks-ahead-of-federal-elections/41633822)).

As someone who is studying Computer Science, I see potential engaging ways of informing others about this issue. Such as through the use of visualisations.
