### International Engagement 
Switzerland is one of the wealthiest countries, with a high quality of life, it has four official languages (French, German, Italian, and Romansh), is prominent a member of the United Nations and has a motto *"Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno"* or in English *"One for all, all for one"*. Not only is Switzerland an International nation with four diverse languages, Switzerland is host to numerous international headquarters such as: CERN - European Organisation for Nuclear Research, WHO - World Health Organisation or GAIN - Global alliance for improved Nutrition.
Despite all this, the Swiss government seems reluctant to grow their diversity and help host refugees.  
Since the 1990's Swiss Asylum Law has required Asylum Seekers to contribute to the costs of hosting them. By law the country is permitted to confiscate assets from those seeking asylum. They are allowed to confiscate up to 1,000 Swiss francs (~ US$995 or ~ €913 euros).

As [*SwissInfo.ch*](http://www.swissinfo.ch/) puts it _"For some, Asylum Seekers are a drain on the economy and a threat to social stability; For others, helping them is a cornerstone of Switzerland’s humanitarian tradition"_ 

Compared to other nations in Europe, Switzerland is in a position where it can help. Recently the racism commission has been highly critical of the Swiss Government and the opposition in the lead up to the  federal election.  What's particularly interesting is how the Swiss feel. News media reports carried the results of a survey showed that just under half think the country should close its borders, at least temporarily, but yet most Swiss still feel it’s important to continue helping some of the hundreds of thousands of refugees trying to reach Western Europe through the Mediterranean. –   ([Source](http://www.swissinfo.ch/directdemocracy/hate-speech_racism-commission-sees-risks-ahead-of-federal-elections/41633822)).

As someone who is studying Computer Science, I see potential engaging ways of informing others about this issue. Such as through the use of visualisations.
