After reading&nbsp;[Aaron Francis](http://aaronfrancis.com/)&#8216; blog [post](http://aaronfrancis.com/blog/2013/2/26/how-i-use-evernote-and-ifttt) about how he uses Evernote and IFTTT I felt inspired to make this post about how I use IFTTT.

At present I have 22 &nbsp;IFTTT recipes. Here are some of my favourite.

## Education related recipes

## Auto post

I try to keep my auto posting recipes to a minimum. &nbsp;I do this, as I hate browsing through a social network and seeing posts that have obviously been *auto posted*. Anyway here are my auto posting recipes:

  * Update my Facebook Status &#8220;Happy New Year&#8221; every year on the 1st of Jan at midnight
  * Update my Facebook Status &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; every year on the 25th of Dec at 11:22 am
