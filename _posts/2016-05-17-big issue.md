This question responds to ideas from the Week 11 lecture and reading. You should prepare your post before your Week 11 tutorial. 

# What is a 'big issue' in your country specialisation? 

Find and choose ONE ethical/social/cultural issue from your country specialisation.

You can find anything you like (and that suits your blog angle). You might choose, for example:

A scandal, debate or problem that has been in the news
An ethical issue for tourism
An issue of equity or social justice
An issue around cultural values
In your blogpost, you will need to:

Explain what makes it a 'big issue'
Consider the issue in terms of your own ideals and values
Critically evaluate your response or perspective
