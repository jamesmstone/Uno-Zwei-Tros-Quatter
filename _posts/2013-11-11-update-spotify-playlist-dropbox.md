How to update to the latest version of this IFTTT Recipe

# Issue Resolved:

## Steps to implement fix:

  1. In your IFTTT recipe change the URL field to [http://ifttt.jamesstone.com.au/?type=&uri=][1] making sure to change:

  * `?type=` to either `?type=full` or `?type=exact`
  * `&uri=` to `&uri=` with your spotify playlist URI appended &#8211; example <http://ifttt.jamesstone.com.au/?type=full&uri=spotify:user:spotify:playlist:4hOKQuZbraPDIfaGbM3lKI> *(Top 100 songs on Spotify)*

  * <del>I&#8217;m after some PHP code that for an rss file on request:</del> 
      * <del>Checks for previous cache of the file</del>
      * <del>If previous cache found:</del> 
          * <del>send current cached file ( would be slightly old)</del>
          * <del>then once sent &#8220;cached version&#8221;</del>
          * <del>get current rss version and update the cache</del>
      * <del>If previous cache not found:</del> 
          * <del>get current rss cache</del>
          * <del>send current rss file</del>
          * <del>then once sent loads &#8220;live version&#8221; to cache</del>
