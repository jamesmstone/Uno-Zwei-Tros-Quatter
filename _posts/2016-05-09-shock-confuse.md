This question responds to ideas from the Week 10 lecture and reading. You should prepare your post before your Week 10 tutorial. 

# How might visiting your country specialisation challenge, confuse, or even shock you?

Find ONE aspect of your country specialisation that differs – in either a small or large way – from your home and/or your routines.

You might choose, for example:

Food or eating habits
Body language or gestures
Hygiene
Clothing
What is acceptable in public and private spaces
Laws or rules

In your blogpost, you will need to:

Explain why it is a difference
Reflect on how the experience of difference might make you feel or react
Consider how (or if) you might minimise ‘culture shock’ or ‘culture confusion’
