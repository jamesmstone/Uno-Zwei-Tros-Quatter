Arrival in utopia
As pointed out on [expatarrivals.com](http://expatarrivals.com), Switzerland can be a stark contrast to some of it's neigbours. Even before you arrive in a major town you begin to get a sense of how orderly and clean everything is. They given the example of a train trip from from Milan to the Italian canton, Ticino. A trip that start off passing through some what coarse Italian landscape passing town after town with partially neglected stations with sides that are in need of much love, or even jut a fresh coat of paint. Before you reach the Swiss border, where you are immediately meet with well maintained, much loved clean stations.

This question responds to ideas from the Week 10 lecture and reading. You should prepare your post before your Week 10 tutorial. 

# How might visiting your country specialisation challenge, confuse, or even shock you?

Find ONE aspect of your country specialisation that differs – in either a small or large way – from your home and/or your routines.

You might choose, for example:

Food or eating habits
Body language or gestures
Hygiene
Clothing
What is acceptable in public and private spaces
Laws or rules

In your blogpost, you will need to:

Explain why it is a difference
Reflect on how the experience of difference might make you feel or react
Consider how (or if) you might minimise ‘culture shock’ or ‘culture confusion’
