As pointed out on [expatarrivals.com](http://expatarrivals.com), Switzerland can be a stark contrast to some of it's neighbours. Even before you arrive in a major town you begin to get a sense of how orderly and clean everything is. They give the example of a train trip from from Milan to the Italian canton, Ticino. A trip that start off passing through some what coarse Italian landscape passing town after town with partially neglected stations with sides that are in need of much love, or even jut a fresh coat of paint.

Then you reach the Swiss border, where you are immediately met with well maintained, well looked after, clean stations. What a Utopia.

However this Utopia comes with a cost, a literal cost. Another culture shock that [many](http://www.culture-shock.me/story/77669) experience is the high cost of everything. As [Florent](http://www.culture-shock.me/story/77669) notices you can learn a lot about a place even from it's airport. Consider Hong Kong or Singapore's airport, instant fast reliable free wifi covers the every meter. Zurich airport, slow costly and timed internet lets you know just how expensive your adventure is going to be. "nothing is free in Switzerland!" [*Florent*](http://www.culture-shock.me/story/77669).
