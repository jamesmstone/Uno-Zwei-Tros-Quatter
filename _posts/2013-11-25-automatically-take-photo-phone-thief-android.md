[Lockwatch Anti-Theft](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bloketech.lockwatch) is an android app that takes a photo using the front facing camera when your passcode is incorrectly entered. It then sends that photo along with the phones&#8217; current GPS location to your email account.

Lockwatch by default has a nice feature enabled to prevent false alarms. This means Lockwatch will give you 10 seconds to type in the correct password before it sends the alert. If you type in the correct password, the alert will be cancelled and you will not receive an e-mail.
