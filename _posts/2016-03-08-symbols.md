When you ask someone to think about the symbols of Switzerland lots of images can come to mind. For some they will conjour images of the beautiful lakes.. For some the amazing Swiss chocolate. The music from an alphorn. Or for many it will be the swiss alps.

However the symbol that comes to my mind the most is a particular mountain in the Swiss Alps. The Matterhorn.

#### Swiss Chocolate
What I think is awesome about the other symbols is that they can all be related back to the Matterhorn.
Take swiss chocolate. One of the most exported brands from Switzerland is Toblerone. Toblerone not has only is there chocolate shapped like a mountain. Their logo literally is the Matterhorn.

#### Alphorn
Or the Alphorn a musical instrument that's name literally has *"Alp"* in it. The `Alp`horn is an instrument that was originally used for communication amongst Swiss mountain dwellers, now it is also used as an instrument.
