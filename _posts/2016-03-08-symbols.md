When asked *"what is uniquely Swiss?"* The first symbol many would conjour, is the Swiss Alps, this is likely because most other Swiss symbols can be linked back to the Alps.  
No matter what symbol you picture, it can somehow be related back to the mountains. Take Swiss chocolate, one of the most exported brands from Switzerland is Toblerone. Toblerone not only has their chocolate shaped like a mountain, their logo literally is the Matterhorn.

Or consider the Alphorn a musical instrument that's name literally has *"Alp"* in it. The `Alp`horn is an instrument that was originally used for communication among Swiss mountain dwellers, now it is also used as an instrument. [[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfQC-XaNEpM)]

The beauty of the mountain range along with the vast array of activities they play host to have made the Swiss Alps, so iconic and symbolic.
Tourism in the Swiss Alps really began in the mid to late 1800's when many of the mountains were first successfully climbed. With the first successful climbs often being by British Mountaineers along with local guides. Now days they still attract mountaineers, bush walkers, skiers, both cross country and down hill and snowboarders.
For climbers there are a vast array of mountains ranging in difficulty and height.  
For skiers and snowboarders there are over [30 ski fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ski_areas_and_resorts_in_Switzerland) the biggest of which, the Les Portes du Soleil, having 650km of ski runs, making it a skiers paradise.

Another side of the Swiss Alps is the [natural fortress](http://www.bldgblog.com/2012/06/various-forms-of-lithic-disguise/) it has provided. 
As described by McPhee in his book, [La Place de la Concorde Suisse](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374519323/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bldgblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0374519323) ,  There are *"networks of tunnels, caverns, bunkers, and surface installations, each spread through many tens of square miles‚Äù* hidden through the Alps.
