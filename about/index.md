Hi I'm James, I'm an Australian student, living in Melbourne, who is looking for an *x-treme* Swiss Adventure.
I got my first taste for the snow when I was 6 years old and have been hooked travelling and skiing ever since.

Extreme not in the normal sense of the word. I'm after an extreme cultural experience, an extreme discovery and also an extreme adrenaline rush.
What draws me to travel the most is the sense of adventure you get exploring and trying new things. 
Below is a photo of me on one of my past travels through the Top End of Australia.

Come with me as I take an extreme approach to everything Swiss; the Alps, the cuisine - particularly the Swiss Chocolate and much more!

Finally, I agree with [Pico Iyer](http://picoiyerjourneys.com/index.php/2000/03/why-we-travel/) when he warns against being a typical *tourist*, we will instead be *travellers* because as he puts it, *"The complaints of the tourists is what excites a traveller"*.
However, the distinction between a traveller and a tourist is harder to define. To me the distinction is drawn based on how *"smart"* they travel. Are they culturally aware? Do they have an appreciation for the different layers of the place?
