Hi I'm James, I'm an Australian student, living in Melbourne, who is looking for an *x-treme* Swiss Adventure.

Extreme not in the normal sense of the word. I'm after an extreme cultural experience, an extreme discovery and also an extreme adrenaline rush.  
Below is a photo of me on one of my past travels through the Top End of Australia.

Come with us as we take an extreme approach to everything Swiss; the Alps, the food - particularly the Swiss Chocolate and much more!

Finally, as [Pico Iyer](http://picoiyerjourneys.com/index.php/2000/03/why-we-travel/) warns, we aren't going to be a typical *tourist*, we will be *travellers* because as he puts it, *"The complaints of the tourists is what excites a traveller"*
