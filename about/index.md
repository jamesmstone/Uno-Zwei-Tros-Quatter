Hi I'm James, come with me as we *travel* through Switzerland on an extreme adventure

Come with us as we take an extreme approach to everything Swiss:
* The Alps
* The food - particularly the Swiss Chocolate

Finally, be warned we aren't going to be a typical *tourist*, we will be *travellers* because as [Pico Iyer](http://picoiyerjourneys.com/index.php/2000/03/why-we-travel/) puts it, *"The complaints of the tourists is what excites a traveller"*
